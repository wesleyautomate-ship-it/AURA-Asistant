# Business Readiness Roadmap for PropertyPro AI

This document outlines the necessary features and architectural changes required to transition PropertyPro AI from its current beta state to a commercially viable, production-ready SaaS platform. The roadmap is based on an analysis of the `PROJECT_COMPREHENSIVE_SUMMARY.md` and the business development sprints detailed in `docs/business/`.

This plan assumes that the initial gaps identified in the "In Progress" sections of the comprehensive summary will be completed first.

## Phase 1: Foundational SaaS Features (Commercialization)

This phase focuses on implementing the core features required to operate as a multi-tenant SaaS business.

### 1.1. Multi-Tenancy and Subscriptions (Sprint 4)

The single most critical step for commercialization is to refactor the application to support multiple, isolated customer organizations.

-   **Backend:**
    -   **Organization-Scoped Data:** Introduce an `organization_id` to all relevant database models (`User`, `Property`, `Client`, `Transaction`, `MarketingCampaign`, etc.).
    -   **Strict Data Isolation:** Update **every database query** across all services and repositories to filter by the current user's `organization_id`. This is a critical security and privacy requirement.
    -   **Subscription Management:** Integrate a payment provider like **Stripe**.
        -   Develop a `SubscriptionService` to manage customer lifecycles.
        -   Implement API endpoints for creating checkout sessions, handling payment webhooks, and retrieving subscription status.
    -   **Tiered Plans:** Define subscription tiers (e.g., Basic, Pro, Enterprise) that gate access to features (e.g., number of AI-generated reports, team member seats, advanced recipes).

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **Billing UI:** Create a `BillingScreen` where organization admins can view their current plan, see usage metrics (e.g., "7/10 CMA reports used"), and manage their subscription.
    -   **Feature Gating:** Dynamically enable or disable UI components based on the user's active subscription plan.

### 1.2. Team Management and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (Sprint 5)

To support team-based customers, the application needs a robust user management and permissions system.

-   **Backend:**
    -   **User Roles:** Add a `role` field to the `User` model (e.g., `admin`, `member`).
    -   **Admin-Only Permissions:** Create reusable API dependencies to protect administrative endpoints (e.g., billing, team management).
    -   **Team Service:** Implement logic for inviting new users to an organization, accepting invitations, and removing members.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **Team Management UI:** Develop a `TeamManagementScreen` for admins to invite, view, and remove team members.
    -   **Role-Based UI:** Hide administrative navigation links and controls (e.g., "Billing," "Team") from non-admin users.
    -   **Collaboration:** Ensure all data generated within an organization (e.g., marketing campaigns, CMA reports) is visible to all members of that organization.

### 1.3. Security Hardening and Auditing (Sprint 6)

To build trust and ensure compliance, especially in an enterprise context, the platform must be secure and auditable.

-   **Backend:**
    -   **Audit Trails:** Create an `AuditLog` model to record every significant action performed by a user (e.g., `CREATE_MARKETING_CAMPAIGN`, `DELETE_CLIENT`, `INVITE_USER`).
    -   **Security Middleware:** Implement standard security headers (`CSP`, `HSTS`) and API rate limiting to prevent abuse.

-   **Infrastructure:**
    -   **CI/CD Security Scanning:** Integrate a tool like **Trivy** into the CI/CD pipeline to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities and fail the build if high-severity issues are found.
    -   **Hardened Docker Images:** Use multi-stage builds and run application containers as non-root users.

## Phase 2: Enterprise-Grade Features and Scalability

This phase focuses on enhancing the product's value proposition for larger teams and ensuring the infrastructure can handle growth.

### 2.1. Advanced AI Recipes (Sprint 7)

Move beyond single-shot content generation to more complex, multi-step automated workflows.

-   **Transaction Coordination Recipe:**
    -   **Functionality:** Allow a user to initiate a "transaction coordination" workflow for a property.
    -   **Implementation:** The system should automatically generate a series of tasks based on a predefined timeline (e.g., "Schedule inspection," "Submit legal documents") and assign them to the agent.
    -   **UI:** A new `TransactionView` to visualize the deal pipeline and track task completion.

-   **Proactive Client Nurturing Recipe:**
    -   **Functionality:** A daily background job that identifies "warm" or "hot" leads who haven't been contacted recently.
    -   **Implementation:** The system will use AI to draft a personalized follow-up email based on the client's profile and recent market activity. It will then create a task for the agent to "Review and send" the draft.

### 2.2. Performance and Scalability (Sprint 7)

Prepare the application to handle a growing user base and increased load.

-   **Backend:**
    -   **Caching Layer:** Implement a **Redis** cache to store frequently accessed, non-volatile data (e.g., property details, user profiles) to reduce database load and improve API response times.
    -   **Database Optimization:** Analyze and add indexes to frequently queried columns to speed up lookups.

-   **Infrastructure:**
    -   **Horizontal Scaling:** Configure the production environment to run multiple, load-balanced replicas of the backend API service to handle concurrent requests.
    -   **Connection Pooling:** Ensure the database connection pool is properly configured to support multiple API instances.

### 2.3. External Integrations (Sprint 8)

Increase the platform's value by allowing it to connect with other tools in the real estate ecosystem.

-   **Backend:**
    -   **Integration Framework:** Design and build a base framework for adding third-party integrations (e.g., CRMs, calendar services).
    -   **API Endpoints:** Create secure endpoints for users to manage connections (e.g., using OAuth2 or API keys) and trigger data syncs.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **Integrations UI:** Develop a settings screen where users can connect, disconnect, and manage their integrations.

## Phase 3: Launch and Post-Launch Refinement

This final phase involves all the activities required for a successful public launch.

-   **Comprehensive Testing:**
    -   **End-to-End (E2E):** Conduct full manual and automated E2E tests of all critical user workflows.
    -   **Load Testing:** Use tools like Locust or Artillery to simulate production load and ensure the system meets performance SLAs.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Review and update all user-facing and technical documentation (`README.md`, API docs, etc.).
-   **Deployment:**
    -   Execute the final production deployment, ideally using a zero-downtime strategy like blue-green deployment.
    -   Intensively monitor all systems post-launch.
