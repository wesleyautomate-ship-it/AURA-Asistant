# Progress Report ? 2 Oct 2025

## Highlights
- **Authentication flow completed**: The web shell now enforces login, persists JWT/session data, and lazily hydrates property/client stores only after authentication succeeds (`client/apps/web/App.tsx`, `client/apps/web/src/components/LoginView.tsx`).
- **Shared service layer refactor**: Implemented full HTTP helper suite with consistent auth/error handling (`client/packages/services/src/api.ts`) and updated property/client/transaction stores to consume the new helpers and canonical `/api/v1/...` endpoints.
- **Marketing feature connected to backend**: Added a marketing service plus a streamlined UI that fetches live templates, triggers `POST /api/v1/marketing/campaigns/full-package`, and seeds a demo listing when inventory is empty (`client/packages/services/src/marketingService.ts`, `client/packages/features/src/marketing/MarketingView.web.tsx`).
- **UX polish for property workflows**: Property form now collects backend-required fields before submission, preventing validation failures; list/detail views refresh immediately after create/update/delete.
- **Documentation**: Captured the active implementation plan (`docs/assistant_implementation_plan.md`) and checklist (`docs/assistant_implementation_checklist.md`) so contributors have a single source of truth.

## Validation Status
- `npm run build` for the web app succeeds locally.
- Docker Compose smoke stack builds the backend successfully, but the frontend image currently fails because the monorepo packages (`@propertypro/*`) are not copied into the Docker build context; the Compose run aborts before services start. No smoke tests or Playwright runs were executed.

## Open Issues / Risks
1. **Frontend Docker build**: Need to copy workspace packages (and optionally prune `node_modules`) into the image so Vite can resolve internal imports. The current error appears during the `npm run build` step.
2. **OneDrive file sync**: Docker emits `archive/tar: unknown file mode ?rw-rw-rw-` warnings when building from the OneDrive directory. Relocating the repo to a standard local path?as planned?will avoid permission metadata issues.
3. **Smoke validation pending**: Without the frontend container, the requested login/property/marketing smoke path and Playwright visual regression remain outstanding.

## Recommended Next Actions
1. **After moving the repo locally**:
   - Re-run `docker compose -f docker-compose.smoke.yml up --build -d`.
   - Ensure `client/Dockerfile.web-smoke` copies `packages/` and the workspace root before building.
2. **Seed data helper**: Consider a one-time script (or Docker entrypoint) that creates the demo agent and sample listing so the marketing flow works immediately.
3. **Smoke flow script**: Prepare a small Playwright or REST client harness that logs in, creates/updates a property, triggers a marketing package, and captures console/API logs for reproducibility.
4. **Visual validation**: Once the frontend container serves on port 3000, execute `npx playwright test --config=playwright.docker.config.ts` and archive the HTML report under `test_reports/`.

## Project Status
- **Backend**: Stable; Docker image builds cleanly, health check wired. Awaiting smoke validation.
- **Frontend**: Feature-complete for marketing/property flows; Dockerization blocked by workspace packaging.
- **AI & Automation**: Local stubs in place; real integrations will require valid API keys before production.
- Overall readiness remains ~70%. Once the Docker build and smoke validation are resolved, the project will be closer to a demonstrable beta.
