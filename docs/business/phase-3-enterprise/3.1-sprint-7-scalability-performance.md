# Phase 3, Sprint 7: Scalability & Performance Optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Improve the application's performance and scalability under load by implementing a caching layer, optimizing database queries, and preparing the infrastructure for horizontal scaling.

## Associated Files

### Backend
- `/backend/app/core/cache.py`
- All services (`property_service.py`, etc.) - Add caching logic.
- `/backend/docker-compose.yml` (Add Redis service)

### Infrastructure
- `/docker-compose.prod.yml` (Configure for multiple replicas and load balancing)
- `/nginx/nginx.conf` (If using Nginx as a load balancer)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Development

-   **Caching Layer**:
    -   Add the `redis` Python library to `requirements.txt`.
    -   In `docker-compose.yml`, add a `redis` service.
    -   Create a `core/cache.py` module to manage the Redis connection and provide simple `get` and `set` functions.
    -   In your services (e.g., `property_service.py`), implement a cache-aside pattern for frequently read data:
        1.  When fetching a resource (e.g., `get_property_by_id`), first check if it exists in the Redis cache.
        2.  If it's a cache hit, return the data from Redis.
        3.  If it's a cache miss, fetch the data from the database, store it in Redis with a TTL (Time-To-Live, e.g., 1 hour), and then return it.
    -   Implement cache invalidation: When a resource is updated or deleted, remove its corresponding entry from the Redis cache.

-   **Database Optimization**:
    -   Analyze the most common query patterns in your application.
    -   Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries to identify bottlenecks.
    -   Add database indexes to frequently queried columns, especially foreign keys and columns used in `WHERE` clauses (e.g., `properties.status`, `clients.nurture_status`).

### 2. Infrastructure

-   **Horizontal Scaling**:
    -   Create a `docker-compose.prod.yml` file for the production environment.
    -   Configure a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the backend container.
    -   Update the `backend` service definition to deploy multiple replicas (e.g., `deploy: replicas: 3`).

-   **Connection Pooling**:
    -   Ensure your SQLAlchemy database engine is configured with appropriate connection pool settings (`pool_size`, `max_overflow`) to handle concurrent requests from multiple backend replicas.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
-   **Caching**:
    -   [ ] Frequently accessed data (like property details) is successfully cached in and retrieved from Redis.
    -   [ ] Updating a resource correctly invalidates its cache entry.
    -   [ ] API response times for cached resources are significantly faster.
-   **Database**:
    -   [ ] Necessary indexes have been added to the database schema.
    -   [ ] The performance of key queries has been benchmarked and shows improvement.
-   **Scalability**:
    -   [ ] The production environment can run multiple, load-balanced instances of the backend service.
    -   [ ] The application remains functional and responsive under simulated load.
