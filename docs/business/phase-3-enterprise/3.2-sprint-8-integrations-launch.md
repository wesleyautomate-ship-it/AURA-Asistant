# Phase 3, Sprint 8: Integrations & Launch Preparation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Develop a framework for integrating with external services (like CRMs), perform all final testing and documentation refinement, and execute the official launch of the application.

## Associated Files

### Backend
- `/backend/app/services/integrations/base.py`
- `/backend/app/services/integrations/example_crm_service.py`
- `/backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/integrations.py`

### Frontend
- `/frontend/src/screens/Settings/IntegrationsScreen.tsx`

### Documentation
- `README.md`
- `/docs/` (All previously generated documents)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Development

-   **Integration Framework**:
    -   Create a new directory `services/integrations`.
    -   Define a base class in `base.py` that outlines the common methods for all integrations (e.g., `connect()`, `sync_clients()`)
    -   Implement a first example integration (e.g., `example_crm_service.py`) that inherits from the base class. This can be a mock or a real integration with a popular, simple CRM.

-   **Integration API Endpoints**:
    -   Create `api/v1/endpoints/integrations.py`.
    -   Implement endpoints to allow users to connect their external accounts (e.g., via OAuth2 or API key) and trigger data syncs. This should be restricted to admins and may be a premium feature.

### 2. Frontend Development

-   **Integrations UI**:
    -   Develop an `IntegrationsScreen.tsx` within the settings area of the app.
    -   This screen should list available integrations and their connection status.
    -   Provide a UI for users to input their credentials (e.g., API key) or initiate an OAuth flow to connect their external accounts.

### 3. Launch Preparation

-   **End-to-End Testing**:
    -   Conduct a full, manual E2E test of all primary user workflows, especially the S.MPLE-inspired recipes, on both iOS and Android.
    -   Verify the subscription and team management flows work as expected.

-   **Performance & Load Testing**:
    -   Use a tool like Locust or Artillery to run load tests against the production-like staging environment.
    -   Ensure the API response times and error rates remain within the defined SLAs under load.

-   **Documentation Review**:
    -   Update the main `README.md` with final setup instructions and a comprehensive project overview.
    -   Review all generated documents in the `/docs` folder for accuracy and completeness.

-   **Final Deployment**:
    -   Create a release tag in Git (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
    -   Execute the production deployment plan, potentially using a blue-green strategy to ensure zero downtime.
    -   Closely monitor all systems (logs, metrics, alerts) immediately following the launch.

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria
