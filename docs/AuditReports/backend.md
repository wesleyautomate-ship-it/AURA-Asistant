# Backend Audit Report

## Scope
- **Objective**: Evaluate FastAPI backend coverage, clean architecture implementation, and readiness to support the PropertyPro AI UX requirements.
- **Key References**: `backend/app/main.py`, `backend/app/api/v1/`, `backend/app/core/`, `backend/app/domain/`, `backend/app/infrastructure/`.

## Application Composition
- **Router Registration**: `backend/app/main.py` dynamically imports and conditionally includes over 30 routers (e.g., `property_management`, `clients_router`, `transactions_router`, `analytics_router`) with prefixes such as `/api/properties`, `/api/v1/clients`, `/api/v1/transactions`, `/api/data`, `/api/chat`.
- **Middleware & Settings**: CORS applied via `CORSMiddleware` using origins from `app/core/settings.py`. Environment variables feed `Settings` with database, Redis, Chroma, JWT, and performance parameters.
- **Dependency Graph**: Shared dependencies (`get_settings`, `get_db`, `get_current_user`) enable injection but adoption is inconsistent across routers.

## Functional Coverage
- **Property Management**: `backend/app/api/v1/property_management.py` exposes SQLAlchemy-engine backed CRUD/search endpoints at `/api/properties`. Queries use raw SQL via `sqlalchemy.create_engine` with minimal validation and no request-level auth.
- **Clients CRM**: `backend/app/api/v1/clients_router.py` implements authenticated CRUD atop `EnhancedClient` ORM models, enforcing RBAC with `require_agent_or_admin` for mutating routes.
- **Transactions & Workflows**: Routers like `transactions_router.py` and `workflows_router.py` are registered but require verification of their schema adherence to frontend expectations.
- **AI Services**: AI-related routers (`ai_assistant_router.py`, `ai_request_router.py`, `ml_*`, `chat_sessions_router.py`) imply RAG/LLM integration; however, `google.generativeai` imports in `main.py` are optional and lack runtime guards when absent.

## Observed Gaps
- **Prefix Inconsistency**: Frontend `usePropertyStore` targets `/api/properties` whereas other stores use `/api/v1/...`. Ensure consistent versioning or add proxy routes to prevent 404s.
- **Authentication Coverage**: Property endpoints omit `Depends(get_current_user)`, contrary to security goals stated in project docs. Direct DB writes without auth create risk.
- **Error Handling**: Many routers rely on broad `except Exception` blocks returning 500 errors without structured detail. Logging of failures is minimal.
- **AI Provider Resilience**: When `google.generativeai` fails to import, the system logs a warning but continues to instantiate routers that may break at runtime.

## Infrastructure & Async Processing
- **Celery Integration**: `backend/app/infrastructure/queue/` hosts celery app definitions used by docker-compose `worker` and `scheduler` services, providing background task scaffolding.
- **Monitoring Hooks**: `app.infrastructure.integrations.rag_monitoring` is conditionally imported, suggesting plans for observability but requiring deployment verification.

## Risk Assessment
- **Security**: Missing auth on key routers exposes CRUD endpoints to anonymous access. Default secrets in settings present production risk.
- **Reliability**: Conditional router imports can silently fail (logged with ⚠️) leaving gaps without automated alerts.
- **Contract Drift**: Lack of generated OpenAPI documentation per domain raises risk of schema mismatch with frontend stores.

## Recommended Backlog Items
- **Enforce Auth**: Add `Depends(get_current_user)` and relevant role checks to property and other raw SQL routers.
- **Endpoint Harmonization**: Align prefixes with frontend clients or update store paths to reduce integration friction.
- **AI Fallbacks**: Wrap AI service calls in feature flags and provide mock responses or graceful degradation similar to `aiCoordinator.ts` on frontend.
- **Structured Logging**: Introduce logging middleware to capture request/response metadata and error traces.
- **Contract Tests**: Generate OpenAPI spec snapshots and verify in CI against frontend TypeScript clients.

## Confidence
- **Level**: Medium-Low. Router surface area is large; samples inspected demonstrate patterns, but full behavior requires deeper testing.
