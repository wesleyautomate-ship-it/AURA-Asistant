# DevOps & Infrastructure Audit Report

## Scope
- **Objective**: Assess deployment tooling, container orchestration, and operational readiness for PropertyPro AI.
- **Key References**: `docker-compose.yml`, `backend/app/core/settings.py`, `monitoring/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Container Orchestration
- **Multi-Service Stack**: `docker-compose.yml` provisions PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB, FastAPI API, Celery worker/scheduler, frontend (Nginx), optional Nginx proxy, and Playwright E2E runner. Health checks are defined for core services (e.g., `pg_isready`, `celery inspect ping`, `curl` on `/health`).
- **Networking & Volumes**: Shared bridge network `propertypro-network` and volumes (`postgres_data`, `redis_data`, `chroma_data`, `backend_logs`, `backend_uploads`) ensure isolation and persistence.
- **Dependency Conditions**: `depends_on` enforces startup order (API waits on db/redis). However, the worker and scheduler only wait for `service_started` on Chroma; consider ensuring `condition: service_healthy` for all critical dependencies.

## Configuration & Secrets
- **Settings Binding**: `backend/app/core/settings.py` loads environment variables through `.env` loader. Defaults (e.g., `SECRET_KEY = "your-secret-key-change-in-production"`) are insecure; production-grade secrets must be injected at runtime.
- **Environment Variables**: Compose file exposes numerous parameters (JWT, rate limits, OpenAI keys), but lacks `.env` template mapping, risking misconfiguration.
- **CORS & Debug Flags**: `ENVIRONMENT` variable toggles allowed origins; ensure staging/production values are set appropriately in deployment pipelines.

## Monitoring & Logging
- **Monitoring Directory**: `monitoring/` contains scaffolding for Alertmanager, Grafana, Prometheus, but these services are not wired into `docker-compose.yml`. Manual integration or separate stack deployment is required.
- **Logging**: API and workers mount `backend_logs` volume; `settings.py` ensures `logs/app.log` directory exists. No centralized log aggregation configured.

## CI/CD & Testing Automation
- **GitHub Workflow**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` orchestrates linting/tests (review contents to ensure coverage). Playwright container `e2e` brings UI testing into compose but relies on manual invocation (`profiles: [frontend]`).
- **Scripts**: Automation scripts in `scripts/` (data pipeline, collectors) require documentation on how they fit into release processes.

## Gaps & Risks
- **Secret Management**: Default credentials for database (`admin` / `password123`) and Redis (`redis123`) in compose file are unsuitable for production.
- **Monitoring Deployment**: Lack of integrated monitoring services prevents real-time visibility. Health checks alone may not capture application-level issues.
- **Profile Usage**: Critical services like `frontend` and `e2e` gated behind profiles; ensure deployment tooling activates the correct profiles or provides instructions.
- **Scaling Strategy**: Compose setup suited for single-node deployment; no Kubernetes or container orchestration plan documented.

## Recommended Backlog Items
- **Secrets & Config**: Introduce `.env.production` templates, use secret managers (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager), and remove insecure defaults from version control.
- **Monitoring Integration**: Add Prometheus/Grafana services to compose or document separate deployment; wire API metrics endpoints to dashboards.
- **CI Enhancements**: Extend GitHub Actions to build images, run backend tests, and trigger Playwright suite; publish artifacts (screenshots, reports).
- **Deployment Guide**: Provide docs covering production rollout, scaling, and disaster recovery (backups for PostgreSQL/Redis/Chroma).

## Confidence
- **Level**: Medium. Compose configuration thoroughly reviewed; monitoring/tooling directories sampled but not fully executed.
