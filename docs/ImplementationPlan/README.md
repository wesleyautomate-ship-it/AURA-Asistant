# Implementation Plan Overview

Updated October 2025 to reflect the unified backend, shared frontend workspace, and AI orchestration stack now in place. Use this directory to track execution detail that complements the high-level roadmap in `docs/PROPERTYPRO_AI_ROADMAP.md` and the release gate tracker in `docs/progress/release-readiness.md`.

## Current Focus
- **Beta Hardening**: tighten quality gates, CI automation, and schema migration discipline.
- **Launch Readiness**: prepare infrastructure-as-code, observability, and multi-tenant safeguards.

## File Guide
| File | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase-01-foundation.md` | Historical context for initial scaffolding (completed). | Archived for reference |
| `phase-02-core-features.md` | Transition notes for core CRM, AI, marketing features. | Superseded by handbook; use for historical insight |
| `phase-03-advanced-features.md` | Early ideation for advanced automation. | Review when planning roadmap Phase 4 |
| `phase-04-launch-and-ops.md` | Operations prep checklist. | Update alongside launch readiness efforts |
| `gap-analysis.md` | Legacy assessment. | Replace with current progress tracker |
| `backend-architecture-refactor.md` | Prior refactor plan. | Integrated into backend handbook |
| `mobile-app-plan.md` | Legacy mobile plan. | Replace with `docs/handbook/frontend.md` sections |
| `data-model-spec.md` | Early schema notes. | Migrate details into Alembic migrations and backend handbook |
| `analytics-and-kpis.md` | KPI definitions. | Update after analytics warehouse plan finalized |
| `api-contracts-v1.md` | Endpoint prototypes. | Replace with `docs/api-endpoints.md` |

## How To Use This Directory Moving Forward
1. When kicking off a major initiative (e.g., analytics warehouse, feature flag system) create a focused plan file here summarizing scope, milestones, and owners.
2. Reference canonical documentation (`docs/handbook/*`) for architecture details to avoid duplication.
3. Archive outdated plans by leaving a short context paragraph at the top pointing readers to the superseding source.
4. Link plan milestones to `docs/progress/dev-journal.md` entries and release readiness gates so progress stays visible.
5. Review and prune this directory every quarter to keep content relevant.

For the active Beta Hardening and Launch Readiness work, prefer the release readiness tracker and the new CI/migration plan (`docs/progress/ci-migration-plan.md`) authored alongside the CI kickoff.
