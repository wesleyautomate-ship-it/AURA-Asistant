# Frontend/Mobile Status Report

Date: 2025-09-23

## Summary
The mobile app under `mobile/` provides a lightweight Expo/React Native prototype with a dashboard, bottom navigation, a command center sheet, and placeholder screens for Tasks, Chat, Properties, Content, and Analytics. Networking helpers exist (`src/services/api.ts`) and configuration is driven from Expo `extra` (`src/config.ts`). The app is a UI skeleton without authentication, persistent state, or real data wiring yet.

## Strengths
- **Structure present**: `App.tsx` composes screens and a bottom nav. Components like `DashboardScreen`, `BottomNav`, and `CommandCenter` map to the product vision.
- **Simple API client**: `src/services/api.ts` provides `apiGet`/`apiPost` with basic error surfacing.
- **Configurable base URL**: `src/config.ts` reads from Expo `extra` envs with sensible default `http://localhost:8000` (aligns with backend compose).
- **Screens scaffolded**: `src/screens/*.tsx` exist for key areas (Dashboard, Tasks, Chat, Analytics, Properties, Content, Clients).

## Gaps / Risks
- **Navigation**: Custom bottom nav is used; no `react-navigation` stack/tabs routing. Deep linking and screen params are missing.
- **State Management**: No store (e.g., Zustand/Redux). `App.tsx` holds local state; cross-screen data and auth will need a store.
- **Auth**: No login/refresh/token storage. Backend provides `/api/v1/auth`; mobile must implement secure storage and auth header injection.
- **Data models**: Types exist in `src/types.ts` but are minimal. Expand to match backend entities (users, roles, properties, tasks).
- **Real API integration**: Screens render placeholders. No calls to property endpoints (e.g., `GET /api/properties/`).
- **Error/loading UX**: No spinners/toasts/retry flows. Network failures will throw unhandled exceptions.
- **Testing**: No component/E2E tests in the mobile package yet.

## Prototype Readiness
- UI shells align with marketing/inspiration screens, enough to demo navigation and layout.
- To reach a working prototype, implement auth and wire at least one real data screen (Properties list and detail) against backend.

## Recommended Actions (Next 1–2 weeks)
- **Auth flow**
  - Implement email/password login screen calling `POST /api/v1/auth/login`.
  - Store tokens in SecureStore/Keychain; attach `Authorization: Bearer` on requests; implement refresh with `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`.
- **Navigation**
  - Introduce `@react-navigation/native` with a stack/tab navigator. Map bottom tabs and nested stacks.
- **State**
  - Add Zustand for session/user state, and query layer (TanStack Query) for API caching and retries.
- **Properties MVP**
  - List properties via `GET /api/properties/` and search filters via `/api/properties/search`.
  - Property detail view calling `/api/properties/{id}`.
- **Error/loading UX**
  - Standard loading states, error banners, pull-to-refresh.
- **Config**
  - Add `.env`-driven config for Expo `extra` and build profiles.
- **Testing**
  - Add Jest + React Native Testing Library; basic smoke tests.

## Validation Checklist
- Login, token persistence, and refresh work.
- Properties list renders data from API and handles empty/error states.
- App runs against Docker backend with CORS configured (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `backend/app/core/settings.py`).

## Effort Estimate to Working Prototype
- Auth + nav + store: 2–3 days.
- Properties list/detail and basic UX: 1–2 days.
- Polish, errors, QA: 1 day.

Overall: 4–6 days to a demo-ready mobile prototype hooked to the backend.
