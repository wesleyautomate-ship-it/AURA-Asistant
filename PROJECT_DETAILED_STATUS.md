### Recent Backend Updates
- Alembic README refreshed (2025-10-02) with migration workflow steps (configure env, create revision, apply migration, check-in, run in deployment, troubleshoot).
- CI pipeline executes Alembic dry run to validate new migrations before merge.
- API wrappers in `client/packages/services` now call `/api/v1/properties`, `/api/v1/marketing/templates`, `/api/v1/marketing/campaigns/full-package`, aligning with backend endpoints.
- Authentication flow integrated via `login` and `refresh` endpoints; front-end `LoginView.tsx` maps responses to store state.

### Stability Metrics
- Unit tests: `backend/app/tests` covering auth, chat, blueprint flows; need additional coverage for marketing and property routers.
- Error budget: No recent production metrics (pre-launch). Local tests show zero critical regressions since workspace refactor.
- Performance: Baseline load tests pending; endpoints currently run against dev database with sample data.

### Dependencies
- Python 3.11 (per CI), requirements pinned in `requirements.txt`.
- SQLAlchemy for ORM, Alembic for migrations, Celery for async tasks, FastAPI for HTTP layer.
- External integrations: Email service (placeholder), task queue (Redis/RabbitMQ assumed), ChromaDB.

### In Progress
- Expand analytics data pipeline to supply new dashboard metrics consumed by web analytics modules.
- Harden property CRUD tests to guarantee compatibility with store normalization logic in `client/packages/store/propertyStore.ts`.
- Document asynchronous job orchestration for marketing package generation.

### Risks & Actions
- Risk: Marketing endpoints returning partial data causing web MarketingView to fallback to demo property. Action: Backend to expose consistent property dataset and error codes.
- Risk: Lack of instrumentation around AI endpoints hinder debugging. Action: Add logging and metrics emitter hooks in `ai_assistant_router.py`.
- Risk: Migration discipline reliant on manual process. Action: Conduct Alembic workshop and enforce PR template checklist.

## Data & Analytics Program

### Current State
- CMA (Comparative Market Analysis) services exposed through `analytics_router.py` and `cma_reports_router.py`.
- Property valuations leverage stored procedures and scoring models defined within domain services.
- Dashboard metrics currently rely on seeded data; real-time integration with production data warehouse pending.
- Analytics UI components located at `client/apps/web/src/components/analytics/*.tsx` awaiting API wiring.

### Completed Work
- Established analytics router with 25 endpoints delivering KPI categories (market activity, price trends, investment indicators).
- Implemented CMA generation and quick valuation endpoints; front-end store normalizes returned payloads for property cards.
- Added analytics utilities in `client/apps/web/src/utils/analyticsUtils.ts` for chart configuration and data shaping.
- Documented analytics requirements in `docs/PROPERTYPRO_AI_ROADMAP.md` and `docs/CONTENT_GENERATION_GUIDE.md`.

### In Progress Items
- Backend: Build aggregated metrics endpoints that align with front-end chart expectations (time series grouped by weeks/months, segmented by community).
- Frontend: Replace placeholder Recharts dataset with live API data, support user-driven filters, and enable CSV/PDF export actions.
- QA: Define Playwright scenarios verifying analytics filters, export triggers, and chart rendering.

### Dependencies & External Inputs
- Requires access to property transaction datasets (staging database) with updated metrics.
- Export functionality depends on backend support for file generation endpoints or client-side data packaging with service worker.
- Data governance guidelines to be authored in `docs/handbook/platform.md` for metrics definitions.

### Risks
- Without real data wiring, analytics screens remain demo-only, risking stakeholder perception of completeness.
- Export features could face performance issues if large datasets fetched without pagination.
- Lack of testing on charts may allow regressions when dataset shape changes.

### Next Steps
1. Backend team to produce `/api/v1/analytics/dashboard` consolidated endpoint with query params for range and segment.
2. Frontend to integrate `useEffect` data fetch in analytics components and surface loading/error handlers.
3. Create automated tests verifying data table exports and chart toggling.
4. Update documentation to include instructions for analytics validation.

## AI Orchestration & Assistant Layer

### Architecture Summary
- Frontend AI requests channeled through `client/packages/services/src/aiCoordinator.ts`, which posts to `/api/requests` (FastAPI route `ai_assistant_router.py`).
- Metrics subscribers set infrastructure for telemetry but currently lack integration with monitoring stack.
- Voice and audio services located in `client/packages/services/src/audioService.ts` and `voiceService.ts` supporting voice prompts.
- Backend RAG pipeline prepared through data loaders in `backend/app/infrastructure/integrations/populate_chromadb.py`.

### Completed Deliverables
- Unified AI request coordinator that tracks request/response/error lifecycle with timestamp and module context.
- Content generation routers provide templated prompts and marketing copy outputs consumed by marketing UI flows.
- AI assistant router handles login-aware requests, verifying user context before generating responses.
- Voice recording UI integrated into Marketing modules, enabling voice-to-text prompts.

### Outstanding Work
- Implement telemetry pipeline: connect aiCoordinator metrics to monitoring stack (e.g., StatsD/Prometheus) and capture latency/tokens.
- Add retry and exponential backoff on network errors to avoid failing user sessions due to transient issues.
- Validate AI response schema to ensure frontends handle structured data safely (e.g., recommended actions arrays).
- Expand prompt library for strategy and negotiation assistants, referencing `client/packages/features/src/strategy/StrategyView.*` components.

### Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Without telemetry, diagnosing AI issues will be manual. Mitigation: integrate metrics collectors before release readiness gate sign-off.
- Risk: Lack of contract tests between frontend coordinator and backend responses could lead to runtime errors. Mitigation: add integration tests with mocked responses.
- Risk: Insufficient guardrails for prompt inputs may allow invalid data. Mitigation: enforce validation schema in backend Pydantic models.

### Next Steps
1. Implement instrumentation in aiCoordinator to publish metrics to a shared event bus or logging.
2. Update `ai_assistant_router.py` to include structured metadata (source docs, confidence scores).
3. Author contract tests under `backend/app/tests` verifying AI endpoints produce expected shapes.
4. Document AI operations and fallback procedures in `docs/handbook/platform.md`.

### Evidence

- Entry point `App.tsx` orchestrates views (dashboard, tasks, chat, profile, properties, etc.) and features (marketing, social, strategy, transactions).
- Components located in `client/apps/web/src/components`; screens under `client/apps/web/src/screens` for specialized flows.
- Store access via `@propertypro/store` (Zustand-based state management).
- Styling uses CSS utility classes (Tailwind-like) embedded in JSX; theme tokens provided by shared packages.

### Key Components
- `DashboardView.mobile.tsx` (shared adaptation for web) handles action navigation and displays tasks, metrics.
- `BottomNav.tsx` replicates mobile navigation experience on web.
- `CommandCenter.tsx` integrates AI command interface.
- `MarketingView.tsx` now re-exports shared feature module from `@propertypro/features` to ensure parity.
- `DocumentManager.tsx`, `TransactionTimeline.tsx`, `TransactionTemplates.tsx` proxies to shared UI components.

### Completed Work
- Converted legacy components to reference shared packages, reducing duplication.
- Implemented login guard; if user not authenticated (Zustand token absent) renders `LoginView.tsx`.
- Configured workspace scripts for dev/build/test/lint in `clientapps/web/package.json`.
- Playwright smoke tests configured; pipeline runs `npm run test:web -- --reporter=list`.

### Pending Enhancements
- Replace mock data (ACTION_ITEMS, MOCK_TASKS) with API-driven state using store fetch functions.
- Implement error boundaries and user-friendly fallback screens for API errors.
- Expand Playwright tests to cover marketing campaign generation, transactions detail navigation, analytics exports.
- Add accessible form validation messaging across login and marketing flows.

### Risks
- Without real data integration, features reliant on sample payloads may break when backend schema changes.
- Playwright coverage limited; regressions in new shared components may go undetected.
- Performance optimization needed for large component renders (CommandCenter, MarketingView).

### Next Actions
1. Integrate `usePropertyStore` and `useClientStore` fetch flows on login success.
2. Implement toasts/snackbars for API success/failure states using shared UI kit.

## Mobile Application (Expo) Status

### Architecture
- Expo-managed React Native app under `client/apps/mobile` with TypeScript.
- Entry file `App.tsx` manages screen navigation using stateful view selection and renders shared components.
- Navigation currently manual (setState), plan to integrate React Navigation stack for deep linking.
- Components under `client/apps/mobile/src/components`, screens under `client/apps/mobile/src/screens`.
- Shared modules consumed from `@propertypro/features`, `@propertypro/ui`, `@propertypro/services`, `@propertypro/store` via workspace symlinks.

### Completed Work
- Marketing, Strategy, Transactions screens reimplemented as wrappers around shared feature modules ensuring parity with web.
- DocumentManager, TransactionTimeline, TransactionTemplates components delegate to shared UI implementations, enabling consistent design.
- Config stub (`client/apps/mobile/src/config.ts`) exposes API base and integration constants.
- E2E placeholders established; lint and typecheck scripts defined in package.json.

### Active Tasks
- Replace manual view switching with React Navigation stack and tab navigators for better routing.
- Configure Expo environment variables (app.json `extra`) to supply API base URL and AI provider keys.
- Validate device builds (iOS/Android) to ensure shared modules render correctly and bundler resolves workspace paths.
- Implement smoke automation (Detox or Expo Router tests) to cover key flows (login, marketing package creation, transactions timeline).

### Risks
- Without proper navigation, deep linking and state persistence across views remain limited.
- Missing environment variable wiring could cause API calls to target localhost incorrectly during production builds.
- Lack of automated testing leaves Expo app susceptible to regressions when shared packages change.

### Next Steps
1. Introduce React Navigation configuration (stack + bottom tabs) aligning with ACTION_ITEMS to screen mapping.
2. Utilize Expo Config Plugins or `.env` support to manage secrets and base URLs.
3. Run `expo prebuild` and device builds to confirm asset bundling for shared packages.
4. Add Detox tests for transactions and marketing flows, integrate results into CI or nightly runs.

### Evidence
- `client/apps/mobile/App.tsx` ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Root component controlling navigation.

## Testing & Quality Engineering Status

### Test Suites Inventory
- Backend pytest suite located in `backend/app/tests` covering authentication, content generation, blueprint flows.
- Additional tests in repository root `tests/` for integration scenarios.
- Playwright E2E tests under `client/apps/web/tests` (needs expansion beyond smoke).
- Manual smoke scripts documented in `frontend_build_issue.md` and `frontend_unification_plan.md`.

### CI Coverage
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` orchestrates multi-job pipeline:
  - Job `backend-tests`: checkout, Python 3.11, pip install, run pytest with `PYTHONPATH=backend/app`.
  - Job `alembic-check`: ensures migrations apply via `alembic upgrade head --sql`.
  - Job `frontend-build`: npm install, lint, typecheck, build, install Playwright browsers, run Playwright tests.
  - Job `summary`: echoes job results.

### Current Status
- Backend pytest passing; coverage metrics not collected yet.
- Playwright smoke tests run but limited to login/dashboard flows.
- No automated tests for shared packages or mobile app.
- Manual QA required for marketing campaigns, analytics, workflow automation.

### Gaps & Risks
- Lack of coverage reports prevents visibility into backend and frontend test completeness.
- Shared store logic untested, high risk for regression when API schema evolves.
- Mobile app lacks automation; manual testing only.
- Observability not integrated with tests; failures require manual log inspection.

### Action Plan
1. Integrate coverage tooling:
   - Backend: `pytest --cov` with coverage thresholds, upload artifact in CI.
   - Frontend: Configure Playwright trace/coverage export, attach to CI summary.
2. Add unit tests for shared packages using Jest/Vitest covering store actions and service wrappers.
3. Create integration tests for marketing campaign creation, transaction timeline updates, client CRUD.
4. Introduce Detox or Expo E2E automation triggered on demand.
5. Document QA runbook aligning with release readiness gates.

### Manual Test Checklist (Current)
- Login with demo credentials and confirm dashboard loads.
- Navigate to marketing view, launch demo campaign, verify result panel.
- Switch to transactions view, ensure timeline renders.
- Open analytics screen, confirm placeholder charts display.
- Use AI command center to submit sample command and verify response (requires backend AI service).

### Evidence
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `client/apps/web/tests`
- `backend/app/tests`
- `docs/progress/ci-migration-plan.md`

## Observability & Monitoring

### Current Assets
- `monitoring/` directory contains monitoring stack configuration (Prometheus, Grafana placeholder).
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` defines services but not yet deployed.
- Logger configuration within backend uses standard Python logging; no centralized aggregator.
- No current mobile/web telemetry instrumentation.

### Required Enhancements
- Deploy monitoring stack and connect backend application metrics (request latencies, error rates, queue stats).
- Instrument aiCoordinator metrics to emit event timings and token counts.
- Add frontend performance metrics (First Contentful Paint, API errors) using browser monitoring tools.
- Configure alerting thresholds (e.g., AI request failure rate > 5%, marketing campaign errors).

### Risks
- Without monitoring, production incidents will be difficult to diagnose.
- Lack of traces for AI interactions can hide latency issues.
- Absence of log aggregation prevents quick root-cause analysis.

### Next Steps
1. Stand up monitoring docker-compose stack in staging environment.
2. Integrate backend with metrics exporter (Prometheus client) and add instrumentation for critical endpoints.
3. Configure log shipping (ELK/OpenSearch) or integrate with existing logging solution.
4. Document dashboards and alert policies in `docs/handbook/platform.md`.

### Evidence
- `monitoring/`
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml`

## Security & Compliance

### Current Practices
- Environment variables stored in `.env`; `.env.example` provided for onboarding.
- Authentication uses JWT tokens with refresh flow; tokens stored in Zustand store with persistent storage.
- Backend includes audit logging for login success/failure events (inserts into `audit_logs`).
- Security roadmap items documented in `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` and release readiness tracker.

### Gaps
- Need comprehensive security review covering JWT secret rotation, password policies, API rate limiting.
- Dev auth bypass search reveals none active, but confirm across codebase.
- Secrets currently plain in `.env`ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Âshould integrate with secret manager for production.
- Pending compliance documentation for data handling (PII), especially within CRM features.

### Action Items
1. Conduct threat modeling session and document mitigations.
2. Add middleware for rate limiting and IP allow/deny lists.
3. Implement secrets management integration (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).
4. Update documentation with security controls and incident response procedures.
5. Add automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) to CI pipeline.

## Appendix F: Key User Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Launching a Marketing Campaign
1. Agent logs in via `LoginView.tsx`, using credentials validated by `/api/v1/auth/login`.
2. Zustand `useUserStore` stores auth token, enabling API requests.
3. Dashboard loads, prompting agent to select Marketing action.
4. `MarketingView` fetches marketing templates via `fetchMarketingTemplates()`.
5. Property data retrieved through `usePropertyStore.fetchProperties`; if empty, demo property seeded.
6. Agent selects template, reviews description, channels.
7. Agent triggers campaign launch; `createFullMarketingPackage` posts to backend with property_id and channel flags.
8. Backend orchestrates campaign creation, returns package_id, message, campaigns map, next steps.
9. UI presents success panel, listing asset counts per channel.
10. Next actions include emailing stakeholders, scheduling social posts, printing postcards (pending integrations).
11. Metrics subscriber records request/response events for telemetry (implementation pending).

### Scenario 2: Managing Transactions
1. Agent navigates to Transactions view from dashboard or marketing follow-up.
2. `TransactionsView` fetches transaction data (currently sample data until backend integration).
3. Timeline component (`TransactionTimeline`) displays stages with due dates.
4. Document manager lists required documents; placeholders until storage integration.
5. Agent updates stage status, triggers automation for next tasks (backend integration planned).
6. Notification system (future) informs clients of updates via marketing automation or workflow scheduler.

### Scenario 3: Analyzing Market Trends
1. Agent opens Analytics screen (web) to review KPIs.
2. Component renders KPI cards with sample metrics; will call analytics endpoint once ready.
3. CMA generator allows agent to input property details and request CMA via `/api/v1/analytics/cma`.
4. Backend generates CMA, storing results for download (download endpoint pending).
5. Agent exports metrics (CSV/PDF) once functionality implemented.
6. Analytics results inform marketing strategy and client recommendations.

### Scenario 4: Client Onboarding
1. Agent opens Contact Management view.
2. Client list loaded (API integration pending) showing segments and tags.
3. Agent creates new client; form submission will call `/api/v1/clients` once wired.
4. Client assigned to marketing campaign; automation scheduler sets follow-up tasks.
5. Communication history updates with notes from AI assistant and manual entries.

### Scenario 5: AI Command Execution
1. Agent opens Command Center via bottom nav or keyboard shortcut.
2. Chooses command mode (voice/text) using shared UI controls.
3. Submits prompt describing desired action (e.g., generate neighborhood report).
4. `aiCoordinator` posts request to `/api/v1/ai/requests` with module context.
5. Backend processes request, retrieves relevant knowledge via RAG, returns response.
6. UI displays response, transcripts, and optional follow-up actions.
7. Metrics subscriber logs latency; telemetry integration will surface in monitoring dashboard.

## Appendix G: Performance & Scaling Considerations

### Backend
- Evaluate ASGI server performance (uvicorn/gunicorn) under concurrent AI requests.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data (property lists, templates).
- Ensure database indexes optimized via `database_index_optimizer.py` for high-volume queries.
- Profile Celery tasks to handle marketing automation at scale.

### Frontend Web
- Optimize bundle size by code-splitting large components (CommandCenter, MarketingView).
- Use React memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders when stores update.
- Investigate service worker caching for static assets.
- Monitor API call frequency to avoid duplicate fetches.

### Mobile
- Ensure shared components use React Native optimizations (FlatList, memoized components).
- Manage memory usage for heavy views (transactions timeline, analytics charts).
- Preload data and assets to minimize navigation delays.

### AI Workloads
- Implement rate limiting and concurrency controls to prevent overload.
- Cache AI responses for repeated prompts where appropriate (subject to personalization needs).

### Infrastructure
- Scale database and message broker resources proportionally to campaign volume.
- Use autoscaling rules based on CPU, memory, and queue length metrics.
