# Backend Status Report

Date: 2025-09-23

## Summary
The backend in `backend/app/` is a fairly comprehensive FastAPI application with many feature routers and a clean-architecture intent. It is close to a runnable prototype via Docker Compose, but it has a few inconsistencies and security items to address before end-to-end flows are reliable.

## Strengths
- Clean app entry and router composition in `backend/app/main.py` with numerous feature routers optionally included via try/except.
- Health check implemented in `backend/app/api/v1/health_router.py` leveraging `check_db_connection()`.
- Auth flows provided in `backend/app/api/v1/auth_router.py` with JWT issue/refresh and audit logging.
- Centralized settings in `backend/app/core/settings.py` and DB session management in `backend/app/core/database.py` with helper checks and default bootstrap (`init_default_data()`).
- RBAC models and audit artifacts in `backend/app/core/models.py` with many-to-many junctions and relationships.
- Alembic initialized with baseline migration `backend/app/alembic/versions/001_phase01_baseline.py` for users, sessions, roles, permissions, audit logs.
- Rich feature surface (data, files, ML, reports, nurturing, etc.) wired in `main.py`.

## Gaps / Risks
- Inconsistent imports and layering in `backend/app/api/v1/property_management.py`:
  - Imports `auth.middleware` and `auth.database` instead of `app.core.middleware` and `app.core.database`.
  - Uses a separate `database_url` default (`postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/real_estate`) distinct from env/example and compose.
- `backend/app/core/database.py` uses `StaticPool` which is typically for SQLite. For Postgres, a regular pool (QueuePool) is recommended. StaticPool may hold a single shared connection and is not suitable for multi-threaded/prod use.
- `backend/app/core/settings.py` contains a fallback Google API key in source (security risk). Must be removed and loaded only via env.
- Some routers in `main.py` are optional and may silently fail to import. This improves resilience but can mask missing dependencies; log + fail-fast in dev may be preferable.
- `backend/models/__init__.py` defines `Base = declarative_base()` that `app/core/models.py` imports as `from models import Base`. This coupling is a bit surprising in a clean-architecture package layout. Consider co-locating `Base` under `app/core/` or a shared `app/db/` module to reduce ambiguity.
- There is a second imperative DB initializer `backend/app/infrastructure/db/init_database.py` that creates tables with raw SQL alongside Alembic. Two schema authorities can drift. Prefer Alembic migrations only.

## Prototype Readiness
- API should start via Docker Compose (`api` service) and expose `/health` and `/api/v1/auth` endpoints.
- Authentication relies on DB rows existing; `init_default_data()` in `core/database.py` will attempt to seed default roles/permissions and an admin user, but Alembic's baseline should be applied first.
- Feature endpoints beyond auth and health likely require additional tables not yet present in the baseline migration.

## Recommended Actions (Next 1–3 days)
- Align imports and environment usage in `app/api/v1/property_management.py` to `app.core.*` and use `get_db()`/SQLAlchemy ORM or unified engine.
- Remove fallback Google API key from `core/settings.py`; require env and fail-fast if missing in non-dev.
- Replace `StaticPool` with default pooling for Postgres (or conditionally use StaticPool only for SQLite/testing).
- Adopt Alembic as single source of schema truth. Migrate the imperative SQL from `infrastructure/db/init_database.py` into proper Alembic revisions, or disable the script in production.
- Add a migration that creates tables used by auth router (`audit_logs` with the fields it writes), and by property module (`properties`, `listing_history`, `property_confidential`). Ensure columns match router expectations.
- Enable stricter startup checks in dev: when a critical router fails to import, log error prominently or raise to avoid silent feature gaps.

## Validation Checklist
- Run: `docker-compose up -d` and confirm
  - `/health` returns `ok` and DB healthy.
  - `/api/v1/auth/login` works after seeding admin; tokens are returned; refresh works.
- Confirm Alembic migrations run and DB schema aligns with code.
- Smoke test `GET /api/properties/` once properties table is created via migration.

## Effort Estimate to Working Prototype
- Fix imports/pool/security: 0.5–1 day.
- Migrations for properties + related tables: 0.5–1.5 days.
- E2E smoke tests and Docker path hardening: 0.5 day.

Overall: 2–3 days to a robust working prototype backend.
