# PropertyPro AI Execution Plan

## Current Focus (Oct 1, 2025)
- Deliver a production-ready mobile dashboard experience for PropertyPro AI.
- Ensure supporting documentation and progress tracking stay in sync with implementation.

## Milestones & Target Windows
- **M1 - Requirements Sweep (Oct 1 AM):** Confirm dashboard data sources, mobile UX expectations, and reuse opportunities across existing RN Web components.
- **M2 - Component Architecture Outline (Oct 1 mid-day):** Finalize structure for DashboardView.mobile.tsx, including subcomponents and styling strategies.
- **M3 - Implementation & Styling (Oct 1 PM):** Build mobile dashboard layout, wire interactions, and harden accessibility/touch affordances.
- **M4 - Visual QA & Polish (Oct 2 AM):** Run Playwright mobile viewport, capture screenshots, and resolve layout issues.
- **M5 - Documentation & Handoff (Oct 2 PM):** Update change tracking, task status, and recommended follow-ups for broader mobile work.

## Component Architecture Snapshot (DashboardView.mobile.tsx)
- **Screen Wrapper:** SafeAreaView + ScrollView with mobile padding, background color, and pull-to-refresh hook for future data wiring.
- **Header:** Title/subtitle block plus optional system health/status chip.
- **Quick Links Strip:** Horizontal list of tappable chips (Tasks, Chat, Analytics, etc.) with accessible hit targets.
- **KPI Cards:** Stacked metric cards (production-ready placeholders) leveraging flex column layout and shared card styles.
- **AI Workspace Queue:** Single-column list of active AI requests with status pills and progress bars tailored for thumb reach.
- **Action Grid:** Two-column grid of ACTION_ITEMS with icon badges, titles, and subtitles optimized for touch.
- **Recent Activity:** Timeline-style list for latest workflows/messages (re-usable pattern for other mobile screens).

## Key Dependencies & Interfaces
- frontend/App.tsx: consumes the mobile dashboard component.
- frontend/src/constants.tsx: source for ACTION_ITEMS and MOCK_REQUESTS.
- frontend/src/types.ts: shared typings for actions and requests.
- Tailwind utility classes exposed via RN StyleSheet equivalents; ensure consistency with BottomNav.mobile.tsx and other RN Web components.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Icon compatibility:** SVG-based icons may not render with RN; fallback to text badges or vector icons as needed.
- **Scroll performance:** Large sections must avoid nested scroll views; use a single ScrollView with section wrappers.
- **Visual drift vs. design:** Use Playwright screenshot diffing to confirm alignment; adjust spacing tokens accordingly.
- **Time boxing:** If advanced telemetry (health status, live data) cannot ship now, stub clean placeholders with TODO markers.
