## 🚀 **Testing & Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Database Migration**
```bash
# Run the AI assistant schema migration
cd backend
python scripts/run_ai_assistant_migration.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- All 9 new tables created successfully
- Indexes and foreign key constraints applied
- Default human expert created
- Updated_at triggers configured

### **Step 2: Backend Testing**
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
python main.py
```

**Test Endpoints:**
1. **Health Check**: `GET /api/ai-assistant/health`
2. **Request Types**: `GET /api/ai-assistant/request-types`
3. **Create Request**: `POST /api/ai-assistant/requests`
4. **Get Requests**: `GET /api/ai-assistant/requests`

### **Step 3: Frontend Testing**
```bash
# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Test Features:**
1. Navigate to `/ai-assistant`
2. Create a text request
3. Test voice request (simulated)
4. View request status and content

### **Step 4: Human Expert Setup**
```bash
# Register as a human expert (via API or frontend)
POST /api/ai-assistant/experts/register
{
  "expertise_area": "market_analysis",
  "specializations": ["cma", "presentations"],
  "languages": ["English"],
  "max_concurrent_tasks": 3
}
```

## 🔧 **Configuration Required**

### **1. Audio File Storage**
```python
# In voice_processing_service.py
UPLOAD_DIR = "uploads/voice"  # Ensure this directory exists
MAX_FILE_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB
```

### **2. AI Service Integration**
```python
# In ai_request_processing_service.py
# Replace simulated AI responses with actual AI service calls
# Integrate with Google Gemini, OpenAI, or other AI services
```

### **3. Speech-to-Text Service**
```python
# In voice_processing_service.py
# Replace simulated transcription with actual speech-to-text service
# Options: Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech Services, AWS Transcribe
```
