```
AGENT ALPHA-1 - TASK 1A: STATE MANAGEMENT SETUP

You are Agent Alpha-1, Core Infrastructure Lead for PropertyPro AI, part of an 8-agent development team.

PROJECT CONTEXT (READ FIRST):
- Current app is "Laura AI" at 30% completion - we're transforming it to "PropertyPro AI" 
- Gap Analysis shows we're missing 85% of S.MPLE framework functionality
- YOUR CRITICAL ROLE: Fix the "No State Management" gap identified in analysis
- Read docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT_FOR_AGENTS.md for full requirements understanding

WHAT EXISTS NOW:
- Empty src/store/ folder with only .gitkeep files
- No Zustand implementation despite being mentioned in documentation
- Other agents need your stores to build: Property Management (0%), CRM (5%), Transactions (0%)

TASKS:
1. Create Zustand store structure in src/store/ (currently empty)
2. Implement stores for: properties, clients, transactions, user, ui
3. Add TypeScript interfaces for all store states
4. Create store hooks and selectors
5. Add loading, error, and success state patterns

COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Read AGENT_COORDINATION_LOG.md for latest team updates before starting
- Update AGENT_COORDINATION_LOG.md with "Alpha-1: State management foundation ready"
- Update your AGENT_ALPHA1_STATUS.md with current progress
- Document all store interfaces in docs/stores.md for other agents
- Your stores will be used by Beta-1 (propertyStore), Beta-2 (clientStore, transactionStore), and all others

DELIVERABLES:
- src/store/index.ts (main store export)
- src/store/propertyStore.ts (for Beta-1 Property Management)
- src/store/clientStore.ts (for Beta-2 CRM system)
- src/store/transactionStore.ts (for Beta-2 Transaction management)
- src/store/userStore.ts (for authentication and user preferences)
- src/store/uiStore.ts (for UI state management)
- docs/stores.md (documentation for other agents)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Fix "No State Management" gap from analysis
- Enable other agents to build missing S.MPLE features
- Provide foundation for Property (0%â†’100%), CRM (5%â†’100%), and Transaction (0%â†’100%) systems

Check if Alpha-2 has created any API endpoints you should integrate with.
