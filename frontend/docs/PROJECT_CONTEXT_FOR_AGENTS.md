# PropertyPro AI - Project Context for Warp Agents
**Based on Gap Analysis Findings**  
**Source:** `PROPERTYPRO_AI_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`  
**Date:** September 26, 2025

## 🎯 **Project Mission Statement**
**OBJECTIVE:** Evolve the now 65%-complete **PropertyPro AI** platform into a fully branded, mobile-first assistant that operationalizes the entire S.MPLE framework for Dubai real estate teams.

**UPDATED FINDING (Sept 26, 2025):**
> Alpha and Beta agents delivered core Property, CRM/Transactions, Marketing/Social, and Strategy/Packages functionality. Remaining gaps focus on cohesive design tokens, AI/voice polish, analytics depth, and responsive/mobile parity.

## 📊 **Current State vs Target State**

### **What EXISTS Today (~65% Complete):**
- ✅ **Technical Foundation:** React 19 + React Native Web, Zustand stores, shared services.
- ✅ **Property & Analytics (Beta-1):** Property list/detail/CRUD, CMA generator, performance metrics.
- ✅ **CRM & Transactions (Beta-2):** Client profiles with lead scoring, transaction timelines, milestone tracking.
- ✅ **Marketing & Social (Beta-3):** Voice-driven campaign builder, template scaffolds, scheduling flows.
- ✅ **Strategy & Packages (Beta-4):** Strategy generation suite, package orchestration, workflow monitor.
- ✅ **Chat Interface:** AI chat baseline with coordinator stub and voice capture.
- 🟡 **Design System:** Tokens pending; color-coding partially applied.
- 🟡 **Mobile Coverage:** Initial `.mobile.tsx` variants only—broad rollout needed.

### **What We MUST Build (Target: 100%):**
- Complete `src/theme/` token rollout (colors, typography, spacing, components).
- Deliver mobile-first layouts and `.mobile.tsx` variants across S.MPLE modules.
- Deepen analytics/CMA automation with interactive visuals and data feeds.
- Unify AI/voice experiences with shared metrics dashboards.
- Replace remaining mock data with FastAPI endpoints and secure auth.

## 🎨 **S.MPLE Framework Requirements**

### **📣 Marketing (~70% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** Voice-assisted campaign builder, property-driven prompts, social scheduling flows.  
**Next:** Expand template gallery (print/postcards), automate email blasts, connect analytics loop.

### **📈 Data & Analytics (~70% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** CMA generator, KPI dashboards, export utilities.  
**Next:** Add interactive charts, predictive pricing, MLS data integrations.

### **📱 Social Media (~60% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** Category workflows, social calendar scaffolds, voice-to-post prompts.  
**Next:** Wire platform APIs, auto-inject property media, enrich template gallery.

### **🗺️ Strategy (~85% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** StrategyView suite, negotiation prep, timeline orchestration.  
**Next:** Generate export-ready briefs, enable collaborator comments, add AI negotiation insights.

### **📦 Packages (~80% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** PackagesView, package builder, workflow monitor, orchestration utilities.  
**Next:** Connect to backend orchestration, add package analytics, surface AI-triggered suggestions.

### **📑 Transactions (~75% → Target 100%)**
**Strengths:** Transaction timeline UI, milestone tracking, document scaffolds.  
**Next:** Integrate e-sign tools, automate milestone comms, deliver mobile-first summaries.

## 🏗️ **Technical Infrastructure Snapshot**

### **Foundation in Place:**
1. ✅ Zustand stores for properties, clients, transactions, UI (`frontend/src/store/`).
2. ✅ Mock API/service layer ready for FastAPI integration.
3. ✅ Voice services (`audioService.ts`, `voiceService.ts`) and `aiCoordinator.ts` scaffolds.
4. ✅ Shared component base from Beta modules (Property, CRM, Marketing, Strategy, Packages).

### **Active Focus Areas:**
1. 🎨 Design tokens (`src/theme/`) for colors, typography, spacing, components.
2. 📱 `.mobile.tsx` rollout to ensure responsive parity.
3. 📊 Analytics visualization upgrades (charts, CMA insights, AIMonitor).
4. 🔗 Backend wiring with Alpha-2 FastAPI endpoints and auth.

### **Risks / Watchouts:**
- Branding cleanup (replace remaining “Laura AI” references with “PropertyPro AI”).
- Mock data reliance until backend integration completes.
- Limited regression/mobile testing coverage; QA plan needed.
- Observability instrumentation not yet installed.
