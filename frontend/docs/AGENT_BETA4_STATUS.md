Status: ✅ COMPLETED
Task B4-B: Packages/Workflow Orchestration (0% → 100%)

---

## Deliverables (B4-A)

- `src/components/StrategyView.tsx` — Main strategy module (teal theme #0891b2)

---

## Integration

- Uses `usePropertyStore` from `src/store/propertyStore.ts` (Beta-1) to populate property selection
- Uses `useClientStore` from `src/store/clientStore.ts` (Beta-2) for audience analysis
- Designed to coordinate with `MarketingTemplates`, `SocialTemplates` (Beta-3) for execution
- Wired into app: selecting `Strategy` in dashboard opens `StrategyView` (`frontend/App.tsx`)
- Color scheme: teal `#0891b2` for Strategy module

---

## Notes for Dependent Agents

- Provides foundation for B4-B Packages orchestration (New Listing Package will chain CMA → Strategy → Marketing → Social)
